It has many features such as:

- **Automatic Timetable Generating** - Just input what activities you need to do, how long they are, and how long you study on each day, and you get a timetable generated!
- **Customisability** - If you aren't free on a day or a range of days, you can input those days and the program will generate your timetable based on that!
- **Unlimited Generations** - Want to generate 5 timetables? Or 100? You can generate as many as you want!
- **Drag and Drop Activities** - If you want to swap 2 activities around, just drag and drop them!
- **Export timetable** - You can export your timetable as a text file!
